| 2009        | Graduated bachelor degree IT at Windesheim Zwolle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
| 2009 - 2018 | **Yourhosting Zwolle**: Mostly PHP/Python (Django) backend work for the company **internally**, combined with very basic web UI stuff. I was automating and fixing a lot of internal stuff (e.g. improving the automatic processing of bank statements), along with provisioning scripts related to the hosting services of the company. | 
| 2019 - now  | **Move Agency Zwolle (formerly Move4Mobile)**: Mainly PHP backend systems, focussed on APIs and background processing. About 99% of these APIs are integrated by app/web developers of the company, in favor of its customers. Worked on a great mix of projects with some well-balanced teams.                                          |
