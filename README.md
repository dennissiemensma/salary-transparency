- ⁽¹⁾ *Monthly gross income, based on 40 hours a week. Excludes other benefits (e.g. 401K, 8% holiday pay).*
- ⁽²⁾ *Unable to find (similar) records for this year. The only data I could find was tainted with working part-time at the time or only having the total yearly income, including other benefits and salary bumps in the same year. Or I could only find my net deposit on old bank records, which does not compare reliably among years as well.*
- ⁽³⁾ *Formerly known as Move4Mobile.*
- ⁽⁴⁾ *Heads up: This diff is a sum of any preceding years with missing data⁽²⁾. You should average it among these years.*
- ⁽⁵⁾ *Also includes an additional (very royal) ``+5%`` "five year anniversary bonus", in 2014, on top of the regular yearly performance reviews.*
